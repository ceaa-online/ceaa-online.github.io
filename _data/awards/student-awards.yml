      graduation. This award is granted annually by the Board of Managers. The recipient must be an undergraduate in the
      School. The criteria for selection are: promoting the best interests of Columbia in general, partaking on
      co-curricular activities connected with the School, actively contributing to student-alumni affairs, and giving
