title: Columbia Engineering Alumni Association
---

The Columbia Engineering Alumni Association (CEAA) is an independent association founded in 1872 to foster and deepen
the bonds of fellowship between the alumni, faculty and students of the Columbia University School of Engineering and
Applied Science. Every graduate of the School is automatically a member, as are undergraduates once they begin the
second semester of their senior year. There are no dues or membership fees; the association’s programs are financed
primarily through the income generated from a number of bequests, especially that of C.P. Davis ’22. The association
currently has more than 27,000 members around the world.

CEAA awards scholarships, provides mentoring and professional guidance to undergraduates, promotes excellence in
teaching, and sponsors a wide range of social and professional events throughout the year. Each year, CEAA awards the
Egleston Medal for distinguished engineering achievement, the Pupin Medal for service to the nation, and the Samuel
Johnson Medal for distinguished non-engineering achievement, to recognize the distinguished alumni of Columbia
Engineering.

Involvement in the Columbia Engineering Alumni Association is a fun and rewarding way to keep abreast of professional
developments, network with fellow engineers from industries ranging from materials science to financial services, and
use your skills for the benefit of your Alma Mater and the advancement of the engineering profession. Some
opportunities for involvement require a commitment of only a few hours; others are more extensive.
