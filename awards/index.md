## [Nominate or Refer a Medal Candidate](#nominate)

Each candidate must be a living person able and willing to be present to receive the award at the time and place
designated by the Board of Managers, typically at the annual awards dinner in late May. However, the death of a
candidate subsequent to being selected for the award does not void the candidate’s selection. In such case the
presentation shall be made posthumously in accordance with a procedure to be prescribed by the CEAA Board of Managers.
